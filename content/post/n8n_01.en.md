## Why Let AI Work for You?

In recent years, ‚ÄúAI agent‚Äù has become a hot topic. Many companies have invested in development, such as MTK‚Äôs Dago project and ChatGPT‚Äôs former Operator feature. Although we are still some distance from true general-purpose AI agents, we can start with more practical tasks‚Äîlike letting AI regularly send out tech news summaries as your personal assistant.

This article will guide you through the first step: using n8n to create your own AI automation workflow. From fetching news via RSS, summarizing with OpenAI, to sending emails through Gmail‚Äîall automatically.

## Introduction to the Automation Tool: What is n8n?

Although there are already many comparison articles online, I won‚Äôt repeat the features and theories here. However, I‚Äôll briefly show you a simple comparison chart to quickly highlight the differences.

## Key Implementation: Quickly Deploying n8n with Docker

Let‚Äôs get started right away!

We‚Äôll deploy n8n using Docker, which is ideal for quickly getting the environment up and running and grasping the big picture.

![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/02-docker.png)

### Step 1: Make Sure Docker is Installed

If you haven‚Äôt installed Docker yet, download and install it from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Step 2: Create a Folder for n8n Configuration

```bash
mkdir -p ~/n8n
cd ~/n8n
```

### Step 3: Create `docker-compose.yml`

Create a new file in the same directory with the following content (you can use your own Gmail OAuth or basic auth):

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "6666:6666"
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=admin123
      - N8N_HOST=localhost
      - N8N_PORT=6666
      - N8N_PROTOCOL=http
    volumes:
      - ./n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
```

### Step 4: Start the Service

In the terminal, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Once started, go to [http://localhost:6666](http://localhost:6666) to access the n8n interface.

If you see the following screen, congratulations‚Äîyou‚Äôve taken the first step!

## Apply the AI Tech Newsletter Template

Next, we‚Äôll apply a pre-made AI tech news summary template to save time from designing from scratch.

### Import the Official Workflow Templates

After registering your n8n account, click ‚ÄúTemplates‚Äù at the bottom left of the site.

There are over 2300+ templates available for immediate use.

![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/05-temps.png)
![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/06-temps.png)

Find the template ‚ÄúPersonalized AI Tech Newsletter.‚Äù

Click ‚ÄúUse for free,‚Äù then ‚ÄúCopy template to clipboard.‚Äù

![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/06-AInews.png)
![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/08-copy.png)

Go back to your environment, create a new file and paste the template:

```bash
Create a file with .json extension
Paste the copied content
In n8n, click + ‚Üí Import from File
Paste the JSON and click Import
```

---

After successfully importing the template, you‚Äôll see a complete workflow. However, many nodes will show a red triangle, indicating missing credentials or configuration.

![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/09-errors.png)

Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîyou only need to configure two key parts:

## Configure OpenAI and Gmail

### OpenAI API Key Configuration

The workflow sends RSS tech articles to ChatGPT for summarization, so you need a valid OpenAI API key.

Click the triangle next to the OpenAI node and select credentials.

![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/10-openAI.png)

To obtain an API key:

```bash
Go to https://auth.openai.com/log-in and log in or register
Then visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
Click "Create new secret key"
Copy the key and paste it into the OpenAI node in n8n
```

![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/11-keys.png)

P.S. API key usage requires payment‚Äîit‚Äôs billed separately from the ChatGPT subscription.

### Gmail API Integration

After the AI summary is complete, Gmail will send the newsletter to your inbox. You need to set up Gmail API through Google.

If it's your first time using Google API, it can be a bit complex. I recommend the following tutorials:

```bash
* üßæ Official n8n tutorial (English):
  How to connect Gmail with n8n

* üßë‚Äçüíª Recommended tutorial (Traditional Chinese):
  RaymondHouch: Full Guide on Connecting Google Credentials with n8n
```

Follow the same triangle click method for setup.

## Common Issues with Google OAuth Verification

If you‚Äôve followed all the steps and reached the Gmail API authentication, but got stuck‚Äîdon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not alone.

It took me about 8‚Äì9 hours to get everything working. The main issue lies in Google OAuth 2.0 verification.

### Why the Problem?

Google OAuth requires a Redirect URI, a publicly accessible URL where Google will redirect you after authentication.

However, most people deploy n8n locally (localhost) or in an internal Docker network, which is not publicly accessible.

So Google can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù your n8n. Here are some solutions:

---

## Solutions:

| Method                      | Pros                              | Cons                                  |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Use Cloud VPS              | Stable, production-ready          | Maintenance required, not free        |
| n8n.cloud official hosting | Very simple, plug-and-play        | Free version limits to 200 executions |
| Cloudflare Tunnel (best)   | Free, flexible, exposes localhost | Requires cloudflared installation     |

---

I chose the Cloudflare Tunnel solution.

## Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

### 1. Install cloudflared

```bash
# macOS
brew install cloudflared

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install cloudflared
```

### 2. Login and Create Tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create n8n-tunnel
```

### 3. Create Config File `~/.cloudflared/n8n.yaml`

```yaml
tunnel: <your tunnel id>
credentials-file: /root/.cloudflared/<your tunnel id>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: n8n.swarkdoit.com
    service: http://localhost:6996
  - service: http_status:404
```

### 4. Adjust `docker-compose.yml` Port

```yaml
ports:
  - "6996:6996"
environment:
  - N8N_PORT=6996
  - WEBHOOK_URL=https://swarkdoit.com
```

Use the port you set for n8n inside Docker. The `WEBHOOK_URL` must be your Cloudflare domain for OAuth redirection.

### 5. Start Service and Tunnel

```bash
docker compose up -d
cloudflared tunnel run n8n-tunnel
```

## Final Check: Running the Automation

Open the n8n editor, click ‚ÄúExecute Workflow,‚Äù and verify each node:

If successful, you‚Äôll see green checkmarks:
![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/13-pass.png)

If failed, you‚Äôll see red triangles:
![n8n homepage](/images/n8n/13-failed.png)

Start debugging if needed üò¢

Once all nodes are checked off, congratulations! You should receive your personalized AI-generated tech newsletter via Gmail within seconds.
