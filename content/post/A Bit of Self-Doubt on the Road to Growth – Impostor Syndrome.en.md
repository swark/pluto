## A Bit of Self-Doubt on the Road to Growth – Impostor Syndrome

Along the journey of growth, there are always moments when we doubt whether we truly deserve where we are. This article is written for you, if you're going through one of those moments.

If you're experiencing self-doubt—feeling like you're not good enough, constantly pushing yourself, sometimes to the point of exhaustion—afraid that even one small mistake will expose the fact that you're not as good as people think you are, then let me tell you: you’re not alone. I feel the same way, and so do many others. You might just be going through something called *Impostor Syndrome*.

### Do You Have Impostor Syndrome?

Impostor Syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where people who have achieved success still feel like frauds, attributing their accomplishments to luck rather than ability. It’s especially common among those recently promoted, given new responsibilities, or who hold themselves to very high standards.

Ask yourself if you’ve ever had these thoughts:

- Always worried about making mistakes at work  
- Pushing yourself to the limit just to make sure everything turns out right, and still worrying afterward if something might have been overlooked  
- Constantly second-guessing your statements in conversations with others  
- Afraid that people will question your competence, as if you’ve done something wrong  
- Feeling like a fraud who just got lucky  

If any of these resonate with you, gently place your hand on your chest and tell yourself, *“I’m already doing great. I’m not alone.”* Research shows that around **70%** of people experience this feeling at some point（[Sakulku, J., & Alexander, J. (2011). *The impostor phenomenon*](https://www.sciencetheearth.com/uploads/2/4/6/5/24658156/2011_sakulku_the_impostor_phenomenon.pdf). *International Journal of Behavioral Science*, 6(1), 73–92.）. Surprising, isn’t it? So don’t worry too much. You’re not alone—and this might just be a phase in your growth, one you may revisit from time to time.

### I've Felt This Way Too

The reason I’m writing this is because over the past two years—or maybe even longer—I’ve often struggled with this same kind of self-doubt. Especially when I first became a team leader. After all, I was the least experienced member on the team. Who was I to lead anyone? Were my decisions right or wrong? Good or bad? These questions constantly swirled in my mind. And I wasn’t just asking myself—I brought these questions to my manager and others around me.

I got some answers, and even some reassurance. I’m grateful for that feedback and support, but the doubts kept creeping back. Every time a message popped up, every time I was about to open my communication app, I’d feel anxious. These moments wore me down bit by bit.

I asked myself “why” so many times, and honestly, I still don’t have a clear answer. But over time, as I sought help and talked to myself more, as I practiced self-affirmation and encouragement over and over again, I started to shift. Looking back now, when I ask myself, “Did I do okay?”—I can say with more confidence, *“Maybe I did alright.”* In a way, I’ve come to accept myself.

### Don’t Be Afraid to Ask for Help

So I want to talk to you, the one who’s feeling lost. If you're facing similar confusion, start by talking to someone around you. Talk about your anxiety, your doubts, those uneasy moments. It could be someone you look up to, a trusted supervisor, or a close friend.

One of my few strengths (maybe?) is that I don’t deliberately hide my vulnerability. If I believe the person is willing to listen and I trust them, I’ll speak openly.

If someone is willing to hold space for your fears and confusion, let them remind you of your strengths. Even if you can’t believe in yourself yet—believe in the people who believe in you. Accepting help doesn’t mean you’re weak.

### Have a Conversation with Yourself

When you’ve already talked to those around you and worry that your repetitive concerns might be bothering them, take a moment and talk to yourself.

So many things seem daunting before we actually start. We dwell on the consequences before we even make a decision. But look how far you’ve come. You’ve already made it here. Whether you were promoted, entrusted with a solo project, or assigned to something no one else could solve—that trust was built from your past actions.

So have a heart-to-heart with yourself. Write down your concerns. Once you get through your current challenge, you might look back and realize it wasn’t as scary as you thought.

And even if you fail—so what? The people who believe in you won’t abandon you because of one setback. You’re still you. Maybe you’re just moving forward a bit slower, but you’re still moving. So don’t be afraid to face yourself. Remind yourself that it’s okay to take things slow. Believe in those who believe in you, and when you need help, speak up.

### A Little Advice for You (and Myself)

**Celebrate your wins.** No matter how small. Even if you feel like luck played a big part, let yourself enjoy that moment. You have it because you deserve it.

You deserve where you are now—and more recognition and trust in the future.

One last thing (I know I’m being wordy). As motivational speaker Zig Ziglar once said:

> “You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.”

It’s a perfect reminder for every moment of self-doubt:  
**It’s okay to move forward slowly.**
